Main Functions of Operating System
• Manages hardware to achieve the best use and performance
by the applications software.
• Executing applications software on hardware devices for the
user.
• Sharing hardware resources among users
• Scheduling of resources.
• Providing user-friendly interfaces for users to use computers
• Separating users from the low-level details of computer
operations.
• Provides valuable services for the user
• Sharing programs and data

History of Operating Systems
• Earliest computers had no OS
• Machine code to access resources;
• Programs executed manually one by one.
• 1950’s Batch processing – earliest OS
• 1960’s Interactive processing, shared systems, real-time
systems
• Late 60’s/Early 70s General-purpose systems – all things to all
users
• Currently
• Simple, user-friendly, GUI systems for microcomputers
Multitasking, networking, security, distributed processing

Operating Systems Components
• Processor Manager – The programs that control the
operations of CPU.
• Includes Scheduler that arranges for the execution of
programs.
• Memory Manager – Controls data storage in main
memory (RAM).
• File Manager – Manages the file system on secondary
storage – directories and files.
• Device Manager – Coordination of peripheral devices.
• Also known as Resource Allocator, includes its own
scheduler components
